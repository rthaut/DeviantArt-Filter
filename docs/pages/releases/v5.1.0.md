# Version 5.1.0 *(February 6, 2019)*

## New Features

- **Custom Placeholder Styles**. You can now control the colors used for the placeholders on filtered deviations. Management Panel/Screen, go to the Options tab, and set the Background, Logo, and/or Text Colors for Placeholders. Note that these settings are ineffective if you have placeholders disabled.
- **Metadata Batch Size**. A new (somewhat experimental) feature has been implemented to allow control over how much metadata is loaded at once (for category and tag filters). Setting this to a lower value may help your browsing performance.

## Bug Fixes

- Clarify and restrict the use of the hashtag symbol (`#`) when creating tag filters ([#57](https://github.com/rthaut/DeviantArt-Filter/issues/57))
