# Version 5.0.0 *(May 13, 2018)*

**Version 5 is a complete re-write.** There is a significant amount of new functionality, which, in combination with modern best/common practices, has resulted in a very different user experience for managing your filters. Please see the [section on Opening the Management Panel/Screen](https://github.com/rthaut/DeviantArt-Filter#opening-the-management-panelscreen) for help.

## New Features

- Filter Tags and Categories
  - In addition to filtering deviations from specific users, you can now filter uses with specific tags and/or submitted to specific categories.
  - Note that there is a slight delay while browsing before your tag and category filters are applied. If your tag and/or category filters do not seem to be working, you may want to [enable the debug indicators for metadata](https://github.com/rthaut/DeviantArt-Filter#show-metadata-debug-indicators) to see if metadata is actually being loaded while you browse.
- Sort and Page through Filters
  - You can now sort your filters and page through them (instead of scrolling through one giant list).
- Improved Import and Export
  - Filters are exported to a file (instead of requiring you to manually copy/paste the data).
  - The import/export interface has been overhauled to provide detailed information about import results.
  - Drag and drop support for importing filters from a file
- Placeholders Show Why a Thumbnail is Filtered
  - Since you are now able to filter by tag, category, or user, the placeholder image (when placeholders are enabled) shows which filter is applied.
- Support for Translations/Internationalization
  - Currently, DeviantArt Filter is only available in English, but version 5 fully supports translations. **If you want to help translate DeviantArt Filter into other languages, please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/rthaut/DeviantArt-Filter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).**
