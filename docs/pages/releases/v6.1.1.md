# Version 6.1.1 *(May 23, 2020)*

## New Features

- **Configure if/when update information is displayed.** You can now fine tune which updates (major, minor, patch, none) show the release notes page when the extension is updated.
- **User filters are now applied to status updates.** Your Users filters are now automatically applied to status updates. Note that Keyword filters are **not** applied to status updates.

## Bug Fixes

- [New Create Filters Modal Shows on All Open Pages](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/140)
- Metadata status indicators/outlines are no longer applied to status updates (since status updates do not have metadata)
- The "history" extension permission is no longer required
- [Management page no longer loads in Waterfox browser](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/141)
