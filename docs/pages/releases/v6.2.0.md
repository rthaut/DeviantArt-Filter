# Version 6.2.0 *(September 18, 2021)*

## New Features

- New context menu on Deviation links to create a User filter directly
- New options for configuring the placeholders:
  - Leave filtered thumbnails clickable
  - Hide the filter reason/type text on placeholders

## Other Changes

- Removed Category filters, as [DeviantArt has basically deprecated categories](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/153)
