# Version 6.1.0 *(RELEASE DATE TBD)*

## New Features

- **Filters can now be disabled on certain pages.** A new "Options" section has been added to the dashboard where you can disable filter functionality for the following pages:
  - Daily Deviations Page
  - Forum Pages
  - Notifications Page
- **Quickly create user, category, and keyword tags from any deviation.** This is accessed by right-clicking on any deviation link/thumbnail and clicking the new "Create Filters from this Deviation" menu option.
  - **NOTE:** The old quick hide icon (`x`) in the upper-left corner of thumbnails has been removed in favor of the new context (right-click) menu.

## Release Notes

Here is a video showing the new filter creation processes, accessed via a right-click menu on any deviation thumbnail/link.
