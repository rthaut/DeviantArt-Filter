# Version 5.0.3 *(June 22, 2018)*

## Release Notes

Upgrading to Version 5.0.3 will reset your cached metadata. **This shouldn't have any noticeable impact, but if do encounter any issues (like metadata not loading, or tag and category filters not working), you may need to restart your browser.**

Also, please be aware that the changes/fixes made in Version 5.0.3 (just like 5.0.1 and 5.0.2) are **primarily for people who are in the Beta Test program for DeviantArt**, which is only available for Core members with paid subscriptions. If you are in the Beta Test program and encounter issues with DeviantArt Filter, please either [send me (rthaut) a private Note on DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/notifications/notes/#to=rthaut) or [create a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rthaut/DeviantArt-Filter/issues) so I can (try to) make DeviantArt Filter compatible with the beta changes.

## Bug Fixes

- [Tag and Category Filters do not Work](https://github.com/rthaut/DeviantArt-Filter/issues/48)
- [Cannot Quick Filter Users from Journal Thumbnails](https://github.com/rthaut/DeviantArt-Filter/issues/52)
