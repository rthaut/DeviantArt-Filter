# Permissions

These are the required browser permissions for DeviantArt Filter.

If you would like to know more about permissions in general, Mozilla has a [support article about permissions](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/permission-request-messages-firefox-extensions), as well as a [guide for assessing the safety of an extension](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/tips-assessing-safety-extension).

Please [submit a new issue](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/new) if you are still concerned about the use of any of the following permissions so the information provided below can be updated to cover common concerns and answer common questions.

## Access your data for sites in the deviantart.com domain

This permission is used to apply filters to DeviantArt pages and to add the quick-hide icon in the upper-left corner of deviation thumbnails.

## Access browsing history

The History permission is used to remove the DeviantArt Filter Management Page from your browser's history.

## Display notifications to you

The Notifications permission is used to display a notification message when upgrading from version 5.x to version 6.x after converting tag filters to keyword filters.

## Access browser tabs

The Tabs permission is used to apply filter changes from the Management Page to all open DeviantArt tabs, to enable/disable the DeviantArt Filter icon, and to switch to the Management Page (if it is already open) when clicking the DeviantArt Filter icon.
