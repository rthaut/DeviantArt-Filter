# DeviantArt Filter Changelog

## Version 5.1 (February 6, 2019)

### New Features

- **Custom Placeholder Styles**. You can now control the colors used for the placeholders on filtered deviations. Management Panel/Screen, go to the Options tab, and set the Background, Logo, and/or Text Colors for Placeholders. Note that these settings are ineffective if you have placeholders disabled.
- **Metadata Batch Size**. A new (somewhat experimental) feature has been implemented to allow control over how much metadata is loaded at once (for category and tag filters). Setting this to a lower value may help your browsing performance.

## Version 5.0.3 (June 22, 2018)

### Bug Fixes

- [Tag and Category Filters do not Work](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/48)
- [Cannot Quick Filter Users from Journal Thumbnails](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/52)

### Release Notes

Upgrading to Version 5.0.3 will reset your cached metadata. **This shouldn't have any noticeable impact, but if do encounter any issues (like metadata not loading, or tag and category filters not working), you may need to restart your browser.**

Also, please be aware that the changes/fixes made in Version 5.0.3 (just like 5.0.1 and 5.0.2) are **primarily for people who are in the Beta Test program for DeviantArt**, which is only available for Core members with paid subscriptions. If you are in the Beta Test program and encounter issues with DeviantArt Filter, please either [send me (rthaut) a private Note on DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/notifications/notes/#to=rthaut) or [create a new issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues) so I can (try to) make DeviantArt Filter compatible with the beta changes.

## Version 5.0.2 (June 16, 2018)

### Bug Fixes

- [User Quick Filter No Longer Works](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/51)

## Version 5.0.1 (June 13, 2018)

### Bug Fixes

- [User Quick Filter Causes All Thumbnails to be Filtered](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/46)
- Fixes the rendering of the category sub-levels when creating category filters

## Version 5.0 (May 13, 2018)

**Version 5 is a complete re-write.** There is a significant amount of new functionality, which, in combination with modern best/common practices, has resulted in a very different user experience for managing your filters. Please see the [section on Opening the Management Panel/Screen](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter#opening-the-management-panelscreen) for help.

### New Features

- Filter Tags and Categories
  - In addition to filtering deviations from specific users, you can now filter uses with specific tags and/or submitted to specific categories.
  - Note that there is a slight delay while browsing before your tag and category filters are applied. If your tag and/or category filters do not seem to be working, you may want to [enable the debug indicators for metadata](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter#show-metadata-debug-indicators) to see if metadata is actually being loaded while you browse.
- Sort and Page through Filters
  - You can now sort your filters and page through them (instead of scrolling through one giant list).
- Improved Import and Export
  - Filters are exported to a file (instead of requiring you to manually copy/paste the data).
  - The import/export interface has been overhauled to provide detailed information about import results.
  - Drag and drop support for importing filters from a file
- Placeholders Show Why a Thumbnail is Filtered
  - Since you are now able to filter by tag, category, or user, the placeholder image (when placeholders are enabled) shows which filter is applied.
- Support for Translations/Internationalization
  - Currently, DeviantArt Filter is only available in English, but version 5 fully supports translations. **If you want to help translate DeviantArt Filter into other languages, please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).**

### Bug Fixes

- [Filters do not Work on Subdomains](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/26)
- [Apply Filtering to Thumbnails in Comments](https://github.com/rthaut/deviantART-Filter/issues/25)
